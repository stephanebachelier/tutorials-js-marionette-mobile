# RequireJS Marionette Boilerplate

## Introduction

> This project combines the application skeleton of a typical **[Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/)** web app with **[RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)** for modularized components. Coupled with the power of **[GruntJS](gruntjs.com)** task runner for development!

It's a simple boilerplate to ease start of a SPA based on some frameworks/librairies often used.

Yeoman generators are great but IMHO not sufficient for an everyday developer. When you're building lots of SPA you're already doing the same things to setup a project. There are a lots of generators on the wild so I decided to create this boilerplate.

## Included JavaScript libraries
 * [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/): Base structure for SPA
 * [Marionette.js](http://marionettejs.com/): Application structure for Backbone Apps
 * [Backbone.babysitter](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.babysitter): Manage Backbone Views, dependancies of **Marionette**
 * [Backbone.wreqr](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.wreqr): Event aggregator, dependancies of **Marionette**
 * [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/): Browser module loader
 * [jQuery 2](http://jquery.com/): jQuery 2 which is faster on DOM than Zepto.
 * [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/): Will be replaced by **lodash** soon.
 * [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/): Templates made easy
 * [superagent](http://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/): A proper implementation to make HTTP request.
 * [fastclick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick): To remove ~300ms delay on click (mobile)
 * [Backbone.Syphon](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.syphon): To serialize form as an object.


## Installation / How-to

First of all, you'll need: **[nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)**, **[bower](http://bower.io/)**. Then run these commands:

* `$ git clone git@github.com:stephanebachelier/webapp-boilerplate.git`
* `$ cd webapp-boilerplate`
* `$ npm install`
* `$ bower install`

And voilÃ ! It should be working correctly, run : `$ grunt serve` and you'll see a page with a little introduction of the Boilerplate.

**Happy coding guys!**

## Grunt? What does it do?

Grunt is used in a lot of tasks here, you can find theses tasks well separated in the folder `/tasks`.

You can find the list of the aliases in `/tasks/aliases.js`

### $ grunt serve

It compiles the files, serve them on `localhost:9000` and opens your default browser to this url.

It will watch the files in `app/scripts`, he will execute these tasks :

* [jscs](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jscs): JavaScript Style Checker
* [jshint](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-jshint): Detect potential errors in your JavaScript code
* [jsonlint](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-jsonlint): Lint your `.json` files
* [csslint](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-csslint): Lint you `.css` files
* [compass](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-compass): Compile your `.scss/.sass` files
* [handlebars](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-handlebars): Precompile Handlebars template
* [lintspaces](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-lintspaces): Check that your code fits to `.editorconfig`

And then reload your page for you if everything is OK! :)

It will also watch the `.spec.js` files in `test` directory, and run the unit tests with karma.

### $ grunt doc

Generates a doc using **[groc](https://github.com/nevir/groc)** and opens it in your default browser.

> Groc takes your documented code, and in an admission that people aren't machines, generates documentation that follows the spirit of literate programming.

### $ grunt changelog

Generate a changelog using git metadata, based on [these commit conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit). View this [CONVENTIONS.md](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/blob/master/CONVENTIONS.md) for a synopsis of the conventions with commit examples.

Here's some output examples:
* https://github.com/btford/grunt-conventional-changelog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
* https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

### $ grunt style

Compile your `.scss/.sass` files and lint them, report errors if any.

### $ grunt lint-code

Lint your `.js` files, report errors if any.

### $ grunt dev

It will watch the `.spec.js` files in the `test` director and run the tests on change.

## i18n support built-in

We have built-in `i18n` support for your HTML5 Apps, check `/data/{lang}/i18n.yaml` where the keys for internationalization are stored. The `.yaml` files will be converted to `.json`.

We added also in `app/scripts/config.js` a method how to determine the locale of the browser, and load the correct language for the user. Nothing to do, it's i18n ready!

You can use directly in your templates the `{{t 'i18n-key'}}` handlebar helper. See `app/scripts/templates/about.hbs` for an example how to use into templates.

## Fixtures support built-in

We have also a built-in support for "fixtures", it works similarly as i18n. There's an example into About view.

## Tests

**[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/)** test runner is used for tests. Configuration is inspired by [Kim's example project](https://github.com/kjbekkelund/karma-requirejs), you should checkout the `README.md` to learn more about the configuration.

> The main goal for Karma is to bring a productive testing environment to developers. The environment being one where they don't have to set up loads of configurations, but rather a place where developers can just write the code and get instant feedback from their tests.

To run the tests, you can use:
* `$ grunt dev` command, it will watch the `.spec.js` files in the `test` director and run the tests on change.
* If you have installed karma cli with `$ npm install karma-cli -g` you can run `$ karma start` to start the tests.

Tests files are located in `/test/spec`, the library used for tests are :

* [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/): A test runner that fits all our needs
* [mocha](http://mochajs.org/): Making asynchronous testing simple and fun
* [sinon](http://sinonjs.org/): Standalone test spies, stubs and mocks for JavaScript
* [chai](http://chaijs.com/): BDD / TDD assertion library

There are some tests example, check out them and test your code!

## Notes

### Commons errors :

* If it fails at `$ npm run-script preinstall` try to run it with sudo: `$ sudo npm run-script preinstall`

### About `yo` generators :

You can always use `yo` generators while using this boilerplate. While you don't try to bootstrap an app with any generator, you should be fine.

```
$ yo backbone:model mymodel
create app/scripts/models/mymodel.js
```

### Other :

* Dev tools are not tested on Windows!
